## Audience

This document targets university professors in Algeria seeking to transform their classes to distance-learning classes

After reading this document, the instructor will learn how to:



*   set a structure of the class online through mailing lists
*   set up different communication channels to interact with the students
*   set up a class calendar and share it with the students
*   set up a Google Drive folder and share it with the students


## What are the available tools to conduct my class online?




![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-1.png "image_tooltip")


The above figure illustrates the space of tools depending on the internet speed. 

**1. Low speed internet for all students**

In this case, all the class has to be conducted offline (no live video-conferencing, etc.). We will describe how to use Mailing Lists to manage the class

**2. Not everyone has high-speed internet**

In this case, most of the class will be performed offline (communicate, lectures, recitation, labs). However, exams for the students who have good internet can be arranged live using Webex or Zoom. Office hours can also be performed live for some students.

**3. Every students has access to high speed internet**

In this case, the professors can use live video-conferencing tools (Webex or Zoom) to conduct most of the class live. Mailing lists can be used to manage course communication.



## How to Structure my Class Online?

There are 6 components of any given class:

**1. Course communication**

How to communicate important announcements to students (new homework released, etc.)? These messages can be directed to one or many students.

How to share a class calendar with students so that everyone is on the same page? (exam times, homework deadlines, etc.)

**2. Lectures**

How to deliver the lecture to students? What if many students don’t have ideal internet speed? 

**3. Recitation (TD)**

How to deliver homework assignments? How to deliver the recitation?

**4. Labs (TP)**

How to deliver the lab presentation? How to submit labs?

**5. Exams**

How to allow students to take exams remotely?

**6. Office Hours**

What are ways for professors or TAs to schedule 1-1 office hours with students?


## Course communication 

**Method 1: Google Classroom**




![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-2.png "image_tooltip")


**Method 2: Mailing lists**

Given that internet speed in Algeria is not the fastest, the best way to manage course communication is probably through a mailing list. Mailing lists allow you to communicate with all the students at once. Mailing lists are also suitable to anyone with poor internet (i.e., students can download emails, receive notifications of new emails, etc.).

The easiest way to create mailing lists is through Google Groups. It is a free service to create mailing lists and to invite students to join them.



*   Professors can send emails to all the students at once 
*   Email access is free to anyone
*   All the emails can be accessed through a website
*   Professors can share a calendar that is visible to all students

**What do I need to set this up?**

First, create a gmail email address. 

1. Visit [www.gmail.com](www.gmail.com)

2. Follow the steps on the video below

**Creating the Mailing Lists**

To create the mailing lists, it is advisable to separate mailing lists based on usage. For instance, for a particular course (ABC), you may create 4 different mailing lists: TD, announcements, Questions/Answers and Labs




![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-3.png "image_tooltip")


To create those mailing lists, please follow these steps:

1. Access your Google Groups account: [https://groups.google.com/](https://groups.google.com/)

2. Create a new mailing list, for example (you can name it anything): module-1234-TD (to be used for TD-related communications). Note the permission settings, adjust them as needed to control who is allowed to post on the mailing list. Note the email address of the list ([module-1234-td@googlegroups.com](mailto:module-1234-td@googlegroups.com)), this email address will be used to communicate with the members.


![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-4.gif "image_tooltip")


3. Add the students’ emails to the list. Those emails can be from any email service (doesn’t have to be gmail)


 
![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-5.gif "image_tooltip")


4. Write an example email to the list: to write an email to the list members, simple write the email as you would any email (the recipient email here will be: module-1234-td@googlegroups.com)

 
![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-6.png "image_tooltip")


The email will be sent to all the list members. You can also view all the lists’ threads from the Google Groups interface:

## Giving lectures

**Live presentations**

Giving lectures over Zoom/Webex is the standard option if your students have a reliable internet connection. In order to share your presentation slides with your students while speaking, you could use the “share screen” feature of Zoom or Webex. However, the “share screen” feature requires a lot of internet bandwidth. A better alternative is to use Powerpoint Online Presentation, which will generate a link you can share with your students to follow your slide show. 

For more details on this Powerpoint feature, please refer to: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/broadcast-your-powerpoint-presentation-online-to-a-remote-audience-25330108-518e-44be-a281-e3d85f784fee?ui=en-us&rs=en-gb&ad=gb](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/broadcast-your-powerpoint-presentation-online-to-a-remote-audience-25330108-518e-44be-a281-e3d85f784fee?ui=en-us&rs=en-gb&ad=gb)

**Offline presentations**

Powerpoint has a “record slideshow” feature that allows you to record your slideshow with your voice on it. Then you can share the presentation video with your students via Google Drive.

For more information: [https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-record-presentations-2570dff5-f81c-40bc-b404-e04e95ffab33](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-record-presentations-2570dff5-f81c-40bc-b404-e04e95ffab33)

## Managing exams

**Live exams**

If internet speed is not an issue for most students, a live exam can be conducted via Zoom or Webex. The students would have to turn on their computer camera before taking the exam. The exam format varies depending on the course, but the students can submit their exam answers electronically via email to the instructor.

**Take-home exams**

If internet speed is an issue, the professor could email the exam document at the scheduled time and then asks the students to email back their answers within a specified time period (for example 2 hours). Ask the students to email their answers to the professor’s email address (which has to be known to the students from the beginning).

## Managing course files

You can use Google Drive to add content to your course. For example, video recordings, documents, etc. The following shows how to create a directory on Google Drive
 

![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-8.gif "image_tooltip")


2. Now we create sub-directories and share them with the right mailing list group (ex: TD)


 
![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-9.gif "image_tooltip")


3. Now, MAKE SURE YOU MARK THOSE DIRECTORIES AS VIEW ONLY so that students cannot change their content.

 
![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-10.gif "image_tooltip")


## Create Class Calendar

Professors may choose to create a Google Calendar that is shared with all the students to communicate important event times (exams, live lectures, etc.). To do so, go to: calendar.google.com, then follow the videos below to create a calendar and share it with your mailing lists

1. Go to [https://calendar.google.com/](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r)

Then add a new calendar for your class (module 1234)


![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-11.gif "image_tooltip")


2. Share the new calendar with your mailing list:



![alt_text](../../images/tutorials/faq-12.gif "image_tooltip")


3. Now every student in the mailing list will have the calendar “module 1234” visible on their Google calendar (this requires students to use @gmail email)

## Useful Tidbits

**I have a university email address, how do I access free tools using my university email?**

Some universities in Algeria (e.g., ESI, USTHB) provide the students with an official school email. Having a school email enables the students to use a variety of free educational tools. For example:

Piazza (www.piazza.com): this is a powerful QA platform that the instructor uses for their class to provide a space for students to ask/answer questions and to post announcements. 

**Are there tools to proctor exams?**

Yes. There are tools to proctor students while they are taking their exams. ProctorTrack is a popular one. This tool is not free. So you only use it if your school has purchased access to this service. ProctorTrack also integrates with popular course management platforms such as Canvas, Moodle and Canvas. More information here: [https://www.proctortrack.com/](https://www.proctortrack.com/)

**My university has access to course management platforms such as Moodle or Canvas, should I use them?**

Course management platforms are very helpful to manage your class end-to-end. If your university has purchased access to one of them, you should seek training to use them effectively. Their websites usually provide a lot of training material:

**How do I share surveys with my students?**

Use Google Forms ([https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/)) for free using your @gmail account. Google Forms allow you to author surveys and then generates a link that you can share with your students. In case you are thinking of doing a multiple choice exams/quizzes, this is the tool to consider.

**How do I communicate my time availability and have my students communicate theirs?**

Use Doodle ([www.doodle.com](www.doodle.com)) which allows you to put in your available time blocks, and then the students can pick whatever time blocks that suit them. This is important to know the best times to schedule important class events (exams, 1-1 sessions, etc.)
